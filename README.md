# Like Button

This project involves building a Like button component in React that changes its appearance based on the user's interaction. The button toggles between a "liked" and "unliked" state when clicked, updating its visual style accordingly. The component also handles asynchronous API requests to register the like or unlike action on a server, showing a loading spinner during the process and handling potential errors gracefully.
